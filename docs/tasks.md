# Fastune Project Tasks

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] Developed and enhanced benchmark script (`examples/benchmark.py`) to compare Fastune PBTSearchCV with Optuna, supporting multiple datasets, runs, and robust reporting.
- [x] Implemented aggregate statistics, convergence plots, score-vs-time plots, and resource usage tracking in benchmarking.
- [x] Added statistical significance testing (paired t-test) to benchmarking.
- [x] Improved benchmark script to handle edge cases and save plots to disk.
- [x] Reviewed and documented advanced PBTSearchCV improvements (adaptive exploration, tournament selection, hybrid mutation, early stopping, etc.).
- [x] Updated documentation (`docs/improvements.md`) to reflect Fastune's advantages and future roadmap.
- [x] Implemented early stopping, hybrid mutation, and reproducibility in `fastune/pbt_search.py`.
- [x] Added comprehensive tests for PBTSearchCV (early stopping, mutation, reproducibility, etc.).
- [x] Updated CI workflow to use Poetry for dependency management and testing.
- [x] Implement parallel evaluation of population members for faster optimization.

## ðŸš§ Ongoing/Planned Tasks

- [ ] Add advanced logging (parameter sets, scores, resource usage, experiment tracking).
- [ ] Integrate resource-aware scheduling (memory/CPU profiling and adaptive allocation).
- [ ] Support hybridization with other optimizers (e.g., PBT + Bayesian optimization).
- [ ] Enhance visualization (interactive plots, more metrics, export options).
- [ ] Expand benchmarking to include more datasets, metrics, and optimizers.
- [ ] Improve documentation and add more user guides and API references.
- [ ] Gather user feedback and prioritize new features based on community needs.
